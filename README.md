# Twitter Sentiment Analysis — Full Project

This repository contains a complete end-to-end project to:
- collect tweets (snscrape or Twitter API)
- store them in Postgres (docker-compose)
- run an ETL + NLP pipeline to classify tweets (positive/neutral/negative)
- a Streamlit app to explore results and run sentiment analysis

See `requirements.txt` and the `streamlit_app.py` for quick start instructions.
